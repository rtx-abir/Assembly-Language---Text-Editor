# Assembly Language - Text Editor

Text Editor done in x86 .TASM using DOSBOX

This project was done as part of my course requirement for CSC 21000: Assembly Language

In DOSBOX make sure the directory where this Editor1.asm and TST.TXT file is located, is mounted as your main directory Once inside the right directory run the following commands:

## tasm Editor1.asm : turns the source file into an object file with .obj extension 

## tlink Editor1 /t : turns the .obj into a .com which is an application file ready to be executed. 

## Now type in the filename: Editor1 <-- and the code should run if you do not want to go through the hustle of running the file the gif below shows how this code works.

### The instructions of using the Editor is on screen provided inside TST.TXT once the Editor1 is running
